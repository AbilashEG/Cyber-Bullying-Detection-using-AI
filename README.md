Cyberbullying Detection: Identifying Hate Speech using Machine Learning

Description
Bullying has been prevalent since the beginning of time, Itâ€™s just the ways of bullying which have changed over the years, from physical bullying to cyberbullying. Due to the massive rise of user-generated web content, particularly on social media networks, the amount of hate speech is steadily increasing. Hate speech online has been linked to a global increase in violence toward minorities, including mass shootings, lynchings, and ethnic cleansing.

This project presents a systematic review of some published research on cyberbullying detection approaches and examine methods to detect hate speech in social media, while distinguishing this from general profanity, and does a comparative study of various Supervised algorithms, including standard, as well as ensemble methods.

Dataset
Tweets Dataset for Detection of Cyber-Trolls obtained from DataTurks
Data Cleaning, Preprocessing (Word Tokenization, Stemming, TF-IDF), and Resampling was done before application of any of the Machine Learning algorithms used.
